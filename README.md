# Facial-keypoints-detection
Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem.  Facial  features vary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a  single individual, there is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose,  size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. Computer  vision research has come a long way in addressing these difficulties,  but there remain many opportunities for improvement.

Each predicted keypoint is specified by an (x,y) real-valued pair in  the space of pixel indices. There are 15 keypoints, which represent the  following elements of the face:

left_eye_center, right_eye_center, left_eye_inner_corner,  left_eye_outer_corner, right_eye_inner_corner, right_eye_outer_corner,  left_eyebrow_inner_end, left_eyebrow_outer_end, right_eyebrow_inner_end, right_eyebrow_outer_end, nose_tip, mouth_left_corner,  mouth_right_corner, mouth_center_top_lip, mouth_center_bottom_lip

Left and right here refers to the point of view of the subject.
